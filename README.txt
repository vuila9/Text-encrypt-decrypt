Program author: John Nguyen (ID: 101162387)

Purpose: The whole program will ask the user to choose if they want to encrypt any plain text they input,
	 or decrypt any ciphertext they input.
	 After choosing, the program will prompt the user to input either plain text or ciphertext, depending
	 on their selection.
	 Finally, the program will print out the result based on their input and selection.
	 Notice, in order to decrypt ciphertext, the user must include '-1' at the end of their ciphertext,
	 or else the program will have to be manually terminated by pressing Ctrl-C.
